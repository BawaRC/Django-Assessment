Question 1: By default are django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.

Answer : By default, Django signals are executed synchronously. That is - When a signal is triggered, the connected receiver functions are executed immediately and block the flow of execution until they are completed. 
The code snippet to support the answer is as follow :-
"""
import time
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def user_saved_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal received for User: {instance.username}")
    # Simulate long-running task
    time.sleep(5)
    print("Signal processing done")

# Simulating saving a user instance
user = User(username='test_user')
user.save()

print("This line will only print after the signal has completed")

"""
Explanation - 
When saving a User, the user_saved_handler signal is triggered. The time.sleep(5) in the signal handler simulates a blocking operation. The message "This line will only print after the signal has completed" proves that the signal is executed synchronously because it only appears after the signal handler finishes.
